# React Brewery Locator 🍻

## Overview

The React Brewery Locator is a reimagined, full-stack version of the very first project I built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Now powered by React, this application leverages the Google Maps API and the Open Brewery DB API to provide a seamless user experience in locating breweries.
